# Farm Manager Mobile Documentation

This directory contains the GitHub Pages documentation for the Farm Manager Mobile application.

## Structure

- `index.md`: Main landing page for the documentation
- `_config.yml`: Jekyll configuration for GitHub Pages
- `/reports/`: Documentation for the Reports module
- `/animals/`: Documentation for the Animal Management module
- `/feed/`: Documentation for the Feed Management module
- `/health/`: Documentation for the Health Management module

## Setup

The documentation uses Jekyll and GitHub Pages with the Cayman theme. The repository is configured to serve these docs from the `/docs` directory on the main branch.

## Notes

This documentation is separate from the application code, which is in the `/www` directory. There should be no duplication between these directories, as they serve different purposes:

- `/www`: Contains the actual web application code
- `/docs`: Contains the documentation for GitHub Pages

To update the documentation, edit the Markdown files in this directory.
