### Understanding Report Details

#### Discrepancy Resolution
When viewing reports, discrepancies and their resolutions are clearly marked:
- Unresolved discrepancies are highlighted in red
- Resolved discrepancies show a green checkmark with the resolution date
- Stock counts that resolved discrepancies are linked and highlighted
- Final counts from resolving stock counts are displayed with the resolution

#### Net Change Display
For animal reports, the "Net Change in Animal Total" shows the overall change in animal numbers:
- Positive numbers (e.g., +5) indicate an increase in total animals
- Negative numbers (e.g., -3) indicate a decrease in total animals
- This takes into account all purchases, sales, births, and deaths
